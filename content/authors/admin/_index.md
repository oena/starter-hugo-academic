Hi! I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Biomedical Data Science](https://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html) at Stanford University and am advised by [Dr. Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/) in the [Health Policy Data Science Lab](http://healthpolicydatascience.org/). Previously, I worked in the [Big Ideas Lab](https://dunn.pratt.duke.edu/) at Duke University and the [Golub Lab](https://golublab.broadinstitute.org/) at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. 

My most up-to-date publication list can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4yh_AcQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). If youâ€™re interested in my work or share interests, feel free to send me a message via Twitter or LinkedIn! You can find my respective profiles via the icons below my photo.
